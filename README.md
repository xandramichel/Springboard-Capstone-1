# Springboard Capstone 1

##Introduction and motivation

AirBnb is a website that allows people to search and reserve short-term and apartment rentals, as well as become a host on the platform by opening up their own space to potential guests. All prices are set by the hosts, and guests/renters can narrow their search by different criteria to find a place to stay within their budget while still meeting their needs. As a host looking to earn supplemental income through AirBnB, it is important to know what the market price for your space is so that you can meet the demand of more consumers and ultimately have more guests book a stay with you.

There are third-party companies out there who provide AirBnB pricing for a fee, but you still aren't told what you should price it at in order to get the most demand. AirBnB also provides hosts with some advice when it comes to pricing, but who knows what attributes they are using to determine those prices, or how successful that value is in attracting guests (as hosts donâ€™t have to go with the suggested price, this would be hard to test!). Within the real estate industry, this would have a big impact for real estate agents and their clients (homebuyers and investors) looking to use a measure like this as part of the bigger picture in describing and analyzing the potential return on investment for a home purchase.

With this project, I hope to create a model that takes in AirBnB listing data and predicts the base price for listings in Los Angeles, CA. I hope to expand this project to other cities and also to use NLP techniques on the text attributes to see if it improves accuracy.
